## Questions

1. What is the purpose of an IP address?

   It's so each device has its own ID when communicating.    

2. What is a DNS? What are the benefits of using domain names instead of IP addresses?

   Domain Name Servers. It's easier to remember and also translates the name into a machine friendly IP address

3. What is the difference between a static IP and a dynamic IP?

   Static IP address does not change. Dynamic IP changes from time to time. 

4. What is the tradeoff between UDP and TCP protocols?

    TCP ports provide reliable communication (akin to say registered post) and UDP ports provide unreliable best-effort communication. 

5. Why can't we use the delay function with Blynk?

   Messes up timing that Blynk provides.

6. What does it mean for a function to be "Blocking"?

   Computes forever and prevents other things from running when it's running. 

7. Why are interrupts useful for writing Non-Blocking code?

   Because it's asynchronous.

8. What is the difference between interface and implementation? Why is it important?

   Implementation is the behind-the-scenes of the interface. It's important because they work together to create a product that works.
